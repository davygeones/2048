# 2048

The inspiration of this project comes when Yiwei was taking Berkeley cs61b, a computer science course focused on data structure and algorithms. In one of the projects of that course, students were to create a playable game of 2048. We think it could be a lot of fun to bring such a game to the class, and have a bit of competition for students. More important, this semester PGE3-EN students are to work for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certificate this semester. By hosting this game on AWS, it provides us a good practice of using AWS, and the experience is worth sharing with other students. Therefore, this project can contribute to the AWS certificate, which in turn enriches our CV.
